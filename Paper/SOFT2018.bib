abstract = {This work addresses the question of the construction of stable perfectly matched layers (PMLs) for a cold plasma in the infinitely large background magnetic field. We demonstrate that the traditional, B{\'{e}}renger's perfectly matched layers are unstable when applied to this model, due to the presence of the backward propagating waves. To overcome this instability, we use a combination of two techniques presented in the article. First of all, we consider a simplified 2D model, which shares with the 3D case one of the difficulties for the PML treatment, namely, the presence of the backward propagating waves. Based on the fact that for a fixed frequency either forward or backward propagating waves are present, we stabilize the PMLs with the help of a frequency-dependent correction. An extra difficulty of the 3D model compared to the 2D case is the presence of both forward and backward waves for a fixed frequency. To overcome this problem we construct a system of equations that consists of two independent systems, which are equivalent to the original model. The first of the systems behaves like the 2D plasma model, and hence the PMLs are stabilized again with the help of the frequency-dependent correction. The second system resembles the Maxwell equations in vacuum, and hence the standard B{\'{e}}renger's PMLs are stable for it. The systems are solved inside the perfectly matched layer, and coupled to the original Maxwell equations, which are solved in a physical domain, on a discrete level through an artificial layer. The numerical experiments confirm the stability of the new technique.},

abstract = {The performance of an ICRH system depends on the coupling capabilities$\backslash$nof the antenna to the inhomogeneous plasma profile in front of it.$\backslash$nThe aim of this study is to understand the key physics phenomena$\backslash$ncontributing to the coupling. It is shown that the following plasma$\backslash$ndensity profile characteristics are decisive: (i) distance between$\backslash$nthe antenna and the wave cutoff density, (ii) position of an optimum$\backslash$ndensity with respect to the cutoff one and (iii) the density gradient$\backslash$nleading from this optimum density to the plasma bulk. At each step$\backslash$nof the analysis approximate relations are derived and the loading$\backslash$ndue to the plasma is compared with that of an isotropic dielectric$\backslash$nmedium in view of the application for modelling or dummy load testing.$\backslash$nExamples are taken starting from the case of the projected ITER antenna$\backslash$narray with its different phasing cases in front of the plasma edge$\backslash$nprofile used in the conceptual design phase. It is shown that, for$\backslash$nthe same antenna�??cutoff distance, slight profile modifications$\backslash$ncan lead to substantial coupling and therefore power capability variations.$\backslash$nStronger profile modifications and some critically shaped resonant$\backslash$nedge profiles are also analysed. The usefulness of a dielectric medium$\backslash$nto simulate plasma loading is discussed in an appendix.},

@article{Jacquot2013b,
abstract = {A novel method to simulate ion cyclotron wave coupling in the edge of a tokamak plasma with the finite element technique is presented. It is applied in the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics. Its main features include the perfectly matched layer (PML) technique to emulate radiating boundary conditions beyond a critical cutoff layer for the fast wave (FW), full-wave propagation across the inhomogeneous cold peripheral plasma and a detailed description of the wave launcher geometry. The PML technique, while widely used in numerical simulations of wave propagation, has scarcely been used for magnetized plasmas, due to specificities of this gyrotropic material. A versatile PML formulation, valid for full dielectric tensors, is summarized and interpreted as wave propagation in an artificial medium. The behavior of this technique has been checked for plane waves on homogeneous plasmas. Wave reflection has been quantified and compared to analytical predictions. An incompatibility issue for adapting the PML for forward (FW) and backward (slow wave (SW)) propagating waves simultaneously has been evidenced. In a tokamak plasma, this critical issue is overcome by taking advantage of the inhomogeneous density profile to reflect the SW before it reaches the PML. The simulated coupling properties of a Tore Supra ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) antenna have been compared to experimental values in a situation of good single-pass absorption. The necessary antenna elements to include in the geometry to recover the coupling properties obtained experimentally are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@inproceedings{Ravera2012,
abstract = {In most tokamak machine for researches on Fusion Energy usually the dominant auxiliary heating system is the Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH). In FAST (Fusion Advanced Studies Torus), a compact tokamak with high toroidal magnetic field (8.5 T) and plasma current (up to 8 MA), the design foresees an ICRH system able to couple a RF power up to 30 MW through six antennas, in the 60-90 MHz frequency range. FAST is a new tokamak machine proposed as a Satellite Tokamak for accompanying the International Thermonuclear Experimental Torus (ITER) programme. Each antenna consists of eight straps arranged in a four rows by two columns array. Many of the RF characteristics of the antenna can be simulated with a good accuracy, using a commercial code as HFSS, by replacing the magnetized plasma with a high permittivity dielectric. Salty water solution can advantageously be used as dummy load. All the relevant parameters of the antenna have been carefully evaluated in a large range of straps' loading by varying the distance between straps and dummy load. For a given maximum voltage sustainable in the line without arcing or breakdown, the power handling capability of the RF system and the improvements in the minimum conductivity (gmin) of the antenna array, produced by inserting in each transmission line a service stub, used for a cooling issue, have been studied. The effects of asymmetries between central and side straps and the impact of the presence of the Faraday Shield (FS) is also investigated. Finally the resilience to the loading variation of a conventional matching unit, made by shifter and stub, is compared to a load tolerant matching based on the Conjugate-T concept. {\textcopyright} 2012 EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC.},
