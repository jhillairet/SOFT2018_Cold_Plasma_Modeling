abstract = {To achieve steady-state operation on future fusion devices, in particular on ITER, the coupling of the lower hybrid wave must be optimized on a wide range of edge conditions. However, under some specific conditions, deleterious effects on the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) coupling are sometimes observed on Tore Supra. In this way, dedicated LHCD experiments have been performed using the LHCD system of Tore Supra, composed of two different conceptual designs of launcher: the fully active multi-junction (FAM) and the new passive active multi-junction (PAM) antennas. A non-linear interaction between the electron density and the electric field has been characterized in a thin plasma layer in front of the two LHCD antennas. The resulting dependence of the power reflection coefficient (RC) with the LHCD power is not predicted by the standard linear theory of the LH wave coupling. A theoretical model is suggested to describe the non-linear wave-plasma interaction induced by the ponderomotive effect and implemented in a new full wave LHCD code, PICCOLO-2D (ponderomotive effect in a coupling code of lower hybrid wave-2D). The code self-consistently treats the wave propagation in the antenna vicinity and its interaction with the local edge plasma density. The simulation reproduces very well the occurrence of a non-linear behaviour in the coupling observed in the LHCD experiments. The important differences and trends between the FAM and the PAM antennas, especially a larger increase in RC for the FAM, are also reproduced by the PICCOLO-2D simulation. The working hypothesis of the contribution of the ponderomotive effect in the non-linear observations of LHCD coupling is therefore validated through this comprehensive modelling for the first time on the FAM and PAM antennas on Tore Supra. {\textcopyright} 2013 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {The finite element method (FEM) has the potential of simulating plasma waves seam- lessly from the core to the vacuum and antenna regions. We explored the possibility of using a versatile FEMsolver package, COMSOL, for lower hybrid (LH) wave simulation. Special care was paid to boundary conditions to satisfy toroidal symmetry. The non-trivial issue of introducing hot plasma effects was addressed by an iterative algorithm. These techniques are verified both analyt- ically and numerically. In the lower hybrid (LH) grill antenna coupling problem, the FEM solver successfully reproduced the solution that was obtained analytically. Propagation of LH waves on the Alcator C and Alcator C-MOD plasmas was compared with a ray-tracing code, showing good consistency. The approach based on the FEMis computationally less intensive compared to spectral domain solvers, and more suitable for the simulation of larger device such as ITER.},

abstract = {The Advanced LOwer Hybrid Antenna (ALOHA) code, has been developed to improve the modelling of the coupling of lower hybrid (LH) waves from the antenna to a cold inhomogeneous plasma while keeping a fast tool. In contrast to the previous code Slow Wave ANtenna (SWAN) (that only described the interaction of the slow wave between the waveguides and the plasma in a 1D model), the equations are now solved in 2D including the contribution of both the slow and fast waves, with a low computational cost. This approach is completed either by a full-wave computation of the antenna that takes into account its detailed geometry or by a mode-matching code dedicated to multijunctions modelling, which is convenient in preliminary design phases. Moreover, ALOHA can treat more realistic scrape-off layers in front of the antenna, by using a two-layer electron density profile. The ALOHA code has been compared with experimental results from Tore Supra LH antennas of different geometries, as well as benchmarked against other LH coupling codes, with very good results. Once validated, ALOHA has been used as a support for the design of COMPASS and ITER LH antennas and has shown to be a fast and reliable tool for LH antenna design.},

abstract = {In most tokamak machine for researches on Fusion Energy usually the dominant auxiliary heating system is the Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH). In FAST (Fusion Advanced Studies Torus), a compact tokamak with high toroidal magnetic field (8.5 T) and plasma current (up to 8 MA), the design foresees an ICRH system able to couple a RF power up to 30 MW through six antennas, in the 60-90 MHz frequency range. FAST is a new tokamak machine proposed as a Satellite Tokamak for accompanying the International Thermonuclear Experimental Torus (ITER) programme. Each antenna consists of eight straps arranged in a four rows by two columns array. Many of the RF characteristics of the antenna can be simulated with a good accuracy, using a commercial code as HFSS, by replacing the magnetized plasma with a high permittivity dielectric. Salty water solution can advantageously be used as dummy load. All the relevant parameters of the antenna have been carefully evaluated in a large range of straps' loading by varying the distance between straps and dummy load. For a given maximum voltage sustainable in the line without arcing or breakdown, the power handling capability of the RF system and the improvements in the minimum conductivity (gmin) of the antenna array, produced by inserting in each transmission line a service stub, used for a cooling issue, have been studied. The effects of asymmetries between central and side straps and the impact of the presence of the Faraday Shield (FS) is also investigated. Finally the resilience to the loading variation of a conventional matching unit, made by shifter and stub, is compared to a load tolerant matching based on the Conjugate-T concept. {\textcopyright} 2012 EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC.},

abstract = {The dielectric load can fairly well simulate the inhomogeneous plasma loading even in absence of description of the anisotropy effects. There is the same determining dependence on the following plasma density and dielectric constant KDprofile characteristics of the coupling performances: (i) distance antenna-cutoff layer and position of an optimum density or dielectric constant value layer with respect to the cutoff one (ii) their gradient between this optimum layer and the bulk regions. The best simulation of the considered ITER profiles (for frequency response and quantitative coupling measurements for the different toroidal phasing cases) is obtained by the relationKD(x)=1+($\omega$pi(x))2/($\omega$$\omega$ci(x) +$\omega$ci2(x)) (KD(x) = $\epsilon$1- $\epsilon$2for multispecies plasma) which puts the plasma and dielectric cutoff for all toroidal wavenumbers at the same position. Effects of dielectric losses are discussed. Good simulation of the frequency response is also obtained for most of the phasing cases with a homogeneous dielectric as water but a larger value of KD≅ 200 would cover all cases. Varying the distance antenna-homogeneous dielectric load can scan a large loading domain covering the one expected for ITER.

abstract = {The antennas presently developed for ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) heating of the ITER plasma consist of a tightly packed array of a large number of radiating straps, in order to deliver a high power density without exceeding radio-frequency voltage standoffs. A recently developed three-dimensional electromagnetic commercial software has enabled important progress in the coupling analysis and optimization of such demanding systems. Approximations allowing these codes to convincingly model the effect of antenna loading by a magnetized plasma are discussed. It is shown that, for the purpose of antenna design calculations, a slab of ordinary dielectric with a high relative permittivity, K D , of the order of (c/V A) 2 , where V A is the plasma Alfv{\'{e}}n velocity, can reproduce the main features of wave reflection and refraction by the plasma edge. Multi-layered dielectrics permit more refined approximations. The numerical application of the approximation is illustrated by a simulation of the JET 'A2' ICRF arrays, which fairly qualitatively reproduces the experimental frequency dependence of the coupling resistance. The same loading approximation is applied to the design of realistic experimental test-bed conditions for antenna prototypes or mock-ups, using water as a means of creating plasma-relevant antenna loading. Application to a scaled mockup of the ITER antenna is briefly presented.},

@article{Becache2016,
abstract = {This work addresses the question of the construction of stable perfectly matched layers (PMLs) for a cold plasma in the infinitely large background magnetic field. We demonstrate that the traditional, B{\'{e}}renger's perfectly matched layers are unstable when applied to this model, due to the presence of the backward propagating waves. To overcome this instability, we use a combination of two techniques presented in the article. First of all, we consider a simplified 2D model, which shares with the 3D case one of the difficulties for the PML treatment, namely, the presence of the backward propagating waves. Based on the fact that for a fixed frequency either forward or backward propagating waves are present, we stabilize the PMLs with the help of a frequency-dependent correction. An extra difficulty of the 3D model compared to the 2D case is the presence of both forward and backward waves for a fixed frequency. To overcome this problem we construct a system of equations that consists of two independent systems, which are equivalent to the original model. The first of the systems behaves like the 2D plasma model, and hence the PMLs are stabilized again with the help of the frequency-dependent correction. The second system resembles the Maxwell equations in vacuum, and hence the standard B{\'{e}}renger's PMLs are stable for it. The systems are solved inside the perfectly matched layer, and coupled to the original Maxwell equations, which are solved in a physical domain, on a discrete level through an artificial layer. The numerical experiments confirm the stability of the new technique.},

The nonlocal hot plasma ELD effect was expressed as a convolution integral along the magnetic field lines and the resultant integro-differential Helmholtz equation was solved iteratively. The LH wave propagation in a Maxwellian tokamak plasma based on the Alcator C experiment was simulated for electron temperatures in the range of 2.5–10 keV. Comparison with ray tracing simulations showed good agreement when the single pass damping is strong. The advantages of the new approach include a significant reduction of computational requirements compared to full wave spectral methods and seamless treatment of the core, the scrape off layer and the launcher regions. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {Although perfectly matched layers (PMLs) have been widely used to truncate numerical simulations of electromagnetism and other wave equations, we point out important cases in which a PML fails to be reflectionless even in the limit of infinite resolution. In particular, the underlying coordinate-stretching idea behind PML breaks down in photonic crystals and in other structures where the material is not an analytic function in the direction perpendicular to the boundary, leading to substantial reflections. The alternative is an adiabatic absorber, in which reflections are made negligible by gradually increasing the material absorption at the boundaries, similar to a common strategy to combat discretization reflections in PMLs. We demonstrate the fundamental connection between such reflections and the smoothness of the absorption profile via coupled-mode theory, and show how to obtain higher-order and even exponential vanishing of the reflection with absorber thickness (although further work remains in optimizing the constant factor).},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The authors, published by EDP Sciences. Detailed designs of ICRF antennas were made possible by the development of sophisticated commercial 3D codes like CST Microwave Studio {\textregistered} (MWS). This program allows for very detailed geometries of the radiating structures, but was only considering simple materials like equivalent isotropic dielectrics to simulate the reflection and the refraction of RF waves at the vacuum/plasma interface. The code was nevertheless used intensively, notably for computing the coupling properties of the ITER ICRF antenna. Until recently it was not possible to simulate gyrotropic medias like magnetized plasmas, but recent improvements have allowed programming any material described by a general dielectric or/and diamagnetic tensor. A Visual Basic macro was developed to exploit this feature and was tested for the specific case of a monochromatic plane wave propagating longitudinally with respect to the magnetic field direction. For specific cases the exact solution can be expressed in 1D as the sum of two circularly polarized waves connected by a reflection coefficient that can be analytically computed. Solutions for stratified media can also be derived. This allows for a direct comparison with MWS results. The agreement is excellent but accurate simulations for realistic geometries require large memory resources that could significantly restrict the possibility of simulating cold plasmas to small-scale machines.},

abstract = {The performance on plasma of the antennas of the proposed ITER ICRF system is evaluated by means of the antenna 24 × 24 impedance matrix provided by the TOPICA code and confirmed and interpreted by the semi-analytical code ANTITER II (summarized in an appendix). From this analysis the following system characteristics can be derived: (1) a roughly constant power capability in the entire 40–55 MHz frequency band with the same maximum voltage in the eight feeding lines is obtained for all the considered heating and current drive phasings on account of the broadbanding effect of service stubs. (2) The power capability of the array significantly depends on the distance of the antenna to the separatrix, the density profile in the scrape-off layer (SOL) and on the strap current toroidal and poloidal phasings. The dependence on phasing is stronger for wider SOL. (3) To exceed a radiated power capability of 20 MW per antenna array in the upper part of the frequency band, with a separatrix–wall distance of 17 cm and a conservative short decay plasma edge density profile, the system voltage stand-off must be 45 kV and well chosen combinations of toroidal and poloidal phasing are needed. (4) On account of the plasma gyrotropy and of poloidal magnetic field, special care must be taken in choosing the optimal toroidal current drive and poloidal phasings.The ANTITER II analysis shows furthermore that important coaxial and surface mode excitation can only be expected in the monopole toroidal phasing, that strong wave reflection from a steep density profile significantly reduces the coupling even if the separatrix is closer to the antenna and that the part of the edge density profile having a density lower than the cut-off density pertaining to the considered phasing does not significantly contribute to the coupling.},

abstract = {The new Alcator C-Mod LHCD system (LH2) is based on the concept of a four way splitter [1] which evenly splits the RF power among the four waveguides that compose one of the 16 columns of the LH grill. In this work several simulation tools have been used to study the LH2 coupling performance and the launched spectra when facing a plasma, numerically verifying the effectiveness of the four way splitter concept and further improving its design. The TOPLHA code has been used for modeling reflections at the antenna/plasma interface. TOPLHA results have been then coupled to the commercial code CST Microwave Studio to efficiently optimize the four way splitter geometry for several plasma scenarios. Subsequently, the COMSOL Multiphysics code has been used to self consistently take into account the electromagnetic-thermal-structural interactions. This comprehensive and predictive analysis has proven to be very valuable for understanding the behavior of the system when facing the plasma and has profoundly influenced several design choices of the LH2. According to the simulations, the final design ensures even poloidal power splitting for a wide range of plasma parameters, which ultimately results in an improvement of the wave coupling and an increased maximum operating power. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},
